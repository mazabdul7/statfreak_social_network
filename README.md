# Statfreak - Helping Students Find 'Home'
To run please install the dependencies located in requirements.txt then run the app.py file to start the web app. A pre-populated database is integrated to allow for better functionality and demo of the application during use.   Send any feedback to zceebda@ucl.ac.uk :)  
   
 Note: Please note all tests but selenium tests run successfully. This is due to device failures that could not be resolved on the host machine. GitHub Actions will show that our pytests run smoothly but the selenium tests tend to fail. The app still functions as expected!
